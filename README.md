# DESC
This web app allows users to create recipes, share them with others, & log what ingredients they have in their pantry

The app can then filter recipes showing you what recipes you can make with your current ingredients. You can also click on recipes and see what ingredients you have/lack in order to make the recipe.

### Currently
Finishing frontend. I might revisit backend for some refactoring.
