# DESC
This web app allows users to create recipes and log what ingredients they have in their fridge right now. 

The app can then filter recipes showing you what recipes you can make with your current ingredients. You can also click on recipes and see what ingredients you have/lack in order to make the recipe.
Whenever a recipe is logged, the ingredients are automatically removed from stored ingredients.

As of right now the REST API has been made.
### Future Plans
I plan to revisit this and make a frontend with React Native in the future.
